However, if the individual has an identified Need for Online Delivery (i.e., score above 3.40), then the following steps are suggested.  In order to increase one’s chances of success online, 1) the individual should complete all recommendations described under the, Proceed with Caution section above. 2) The individual should access and complete the tutorials below that meet the respective deficit skill set. 3) If a Computer Skills deficiency is identified, completion of a basic computer applications course is recommended. 4) If an Academic Skills deficiency is identified, completion of an introductory English (composition and rhetoric) course is recommended), and 5) if the individual is identified as a dependent learner, one should consider using the following strategies once enrolled in an online course: Keep an electronic calendar of assignment due dates that sends audible reminders (alarms), Establish rapport with a classmate quickly and obtain her feedback on assignments prior to submitting them for grading, and Discuss the deficit area with the course instructor early to determine how impactful he/she feels it will be given the course requirements.</p> -->
